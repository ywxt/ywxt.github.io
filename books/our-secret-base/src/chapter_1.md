# Chapter 1: Mermaid on the Highway

The Summer of 2005, Yan Jingxing returns to his hometown with his uncle.

The place is called Baiyue Town, nestled against the green mountains and facing the sea. With a harbor and fishing village along the shore, it is a typical seaside town.

Baiyue Town is not far from Jinjiang City. The drive from the city center takes about three and a half hours, with buses and coaches traveling back and forth.

If it is just a visit to family or a summer retreat, he might feel quite happy. Occasionally getting away from the city, enjoying the leisurely rural life, and having some stories to share with classmates upon return.

Unfortunately, Yan Jingxing is actually settling there. His uncle has already found a new school for him to transfer to, and he leaves in a hurry, not even having time to bid farewell to his high school friends, leaving a hint of resentment in his heart.

Yan Jingxing's parents live abroad throughout the year, and he hasn't seen them for an average of one or two years since the fourth grade. Since then, his uncle Yan Yongzhi has been taking care of him.

Currently, due to a job transfer, Yan Yongzhi moves from a city school to a town, and Yan Jingxing has to go with him.

...

The car smoothly travels on the highway, and the cabin experiences a rhythmic, slight vibration.

The man sitting in the driver's seat holds the steering wheel, looking relaxed. Old songs from Hong Kong and Taiwan play on the radio, and he hums along off-key. The warm breeze of the summer, slightly intoxicated, rushes in through the open windows.

The teenager sitting in the passenger seat, supporting his chin with one hand, lazily gazes at the monotonous highway scenery speeding by.

The silence, without anyone speaking, lasts for a while. Yan Jingxing can't help but bring up the topic he has mentioned several times before.

"Uncle, I've said before, I could have stayed in the city. I can take care of myself. When you used to work overtime, I was always..."

"That was temporary, and it's different. You're still a minor. How can you not be with your guardian?"

Yan Yongzhi taps the steering wheel with his fingers, observing the rearview mirror while comforting him.

"Don't be too upset. There are fun things in the city, and there are also beautiful sceneries in the countryside. Baiyue Town is where your dad and I grew up. There are quite a few interesting things in the town."

"Really? Like what?"

"Well, let me think. I remember when we were there, during festivals, there were markets and temple fairs. I don't know if they still have them. Because it's close to the seaside, you can go to the shore anytime to fish or swim."

"What else?"

"There are a few islands near the town. Some are tourist attractions, and some are places for burning incense and praying. Someone can take a ferry on weekends. When I have time, I'll take you there. Your dad and I used to sneak on the ferry without telling the adults. While went to the island, we could play for a whole day, and there was a time when we almost couldn't make it back...."

At this point, Yan Yongzhi suddenly realizes that such stories shouldn't be told to a child, a bad example, and stops talking.

"Sounds pretty good. Will you go with me?"

"Of course. I said, when I have time."

"When will you have time?"

"Well..."

Yan Yongzhi hesitates for a moment and decides to tell the truth.

"I just started my new job, and I'll be busy for a while. I haven't even prepared my teaching materials."

"Isn't that the same as saying nothing?"

Yan Jingxing pouts, pulls down the seat armrest, and leans back lazily.

"You just transferred schools. Go get to know your new classmates, build good relationships with them. Also, I haven't seen you study during this time. Don't let your grades drop. We can discuss playing later...."

Yan Yongzhi's nagging makes him stop listening. The teenager sighs, reclines in his seat, and continues to stare at the scenery outside the window.

However, as he gradually empties his mind, drowsiness naturally surges into his mind. His upper and lower eyelids begin to fight.

At the same time, a faint, ethereal singing voice comes from a distance. Beautiful and clear, like the clear lake in the mountains, the voice belongs to a maiden.

In a daze, he thinks it is the sound from the radio. Yan Jingxing quickly realizes that the voice is sometimes near and sometimes far, and it obviously don't come from beside him.

But... singing?

This is in a car on a highway. Where does the singing come from?

Suddenly, his entire consciousness wakes up, and he subconsciously widens his eyes, looking into the distance.

What is that?

It seems like a person...

He thinks he might have seen it wrong.

The scenery around the highway flashes at the edge of his vision. Beside the guardrail is a cliff, and below the cliff is the blue sea, with waves constantly rolling and splashing countless foam on the dark rocks.

He grabs the seatbelt on him, turning his head back to look.

—There is a slender figure, as if from the depths of the sea, sitting quietly on a giant reef.

With her back against the sky, she has long, seaweed-like hair that shimmered with golden brilliance in the dazzling sunlight.

She is singing an unknown ancient ballad, her clear and melodious voice lingering in the airspace above the highway.

In a blink of an eye, the car has quickly left the original place, and the figure on the reef disappears from view.

However, he can't help but stare with wide eyes, feeling that this scene is unforgettable.

Truly a wonderful sight.

That person, simply... like a mermaid from a fairy tale...

"Uncle, did you hear that just now?"

He turns around, unable to resist asking.

"Huh? What sound?"

Yan Yongzhi, who is humming along with the music on the radio, seemed completely unaware of what had just happened.

"Singing, someone was singing."

"Singing?"

Yan Yongzhi turns off the radio, listens carefully for a while, and says casually, "I didn't hear anything. What's wrong?"

"...Forget it, it's nothing."

Although he said "forget it," his heart can't help but beat uncontrollably.

The scene just now is deeply imprinted in his mind, making Yan Jingxing inexplicably impulsive.

At this moment, he sees some buildings not far from the front of the highway.

"Uncle, I see a rest area ahead?"

"Ah... there is. What's wrong?"

"I want to pee."

"Is it urgent?"

"Yeah, can't hold it."

"Alright, I'll stop here for a while."

The car slowly enters the lane leading to the rest area.

"I'll go smoke a cigarette, you can go if you want."

Yan Yongzhi turns off the engine, props open the car door, and is about to say a few words when he sees Yan Jingxing has already jumped out of the car and runs towards the sea.

"We're almost in the town, don't go too far!"

"Okay!"

Without looking back, the teenager shouts in response.

"This kid..."

Yan Yongzhi lits a cigarette, looking puzzled as he watches his nephew's figure.

"He was just sulking earlier, and now he's excited."

...

"Hoo... hoo..."

Like driven by a strong premonition, he can't cool down his fervent thoughts.

Amidst the chaotic thoughts, Yan Jingxing has already left the rest stop, stretching his legs and running on the overgrown slope by the shore.

He can't discern a specific direction, just exerting all his strength to move forward.

The fresh scent emanating from the vegetation mixes with the salty sea breeze brushing against his cheeks. Soft soil underfoot resembles a vast, thick carpet extending endlessly.

The sun hangs high, generously casting intense radiance on his hair and shoulders. As Yan Jingxing runs, he feels the heat throughout his body, accompanied by a dizzying sensation.

Before long, he begins to feel strained, and sweat streams down his forehead.

After exerting himself in this mad dash, minutes passes, and the young man's steps gradually slows. Finally, he is exhausted, leaning on his knees and panting heavily.

While taking deep breaths, Yan Jingxing turns his head, realizing that the rest stop is nowhere in sight.

Beside him is a winding road built along the mountainside, and vehicles speed by occasionally.

"What am I even doing..."

In fact, the brief glimpse he just has is not enough for him to determine the exact location of the "mermaid" and the reef she was on. Considering the speed of the car, perhaps the distance between her and himself is even greater than he imagines.

Straightening his posture, he places his hands over his forehead like a visor and walks to the edge of the cliff to gaze into the distance:

The winding road, like a serpent, towering and rugged mountains, and the boundless sea in the distance.

At the horizon is the sight of the "meeting of sea and sky" where everything seems to blend into a vast expanse of white.

Apart from that, there is nothing else.

The incessant sound of the sea tide echoes in his ears, with white waves constantly rolling onto the shore, leaving moist traces on the muddy ground.

Yan Jingxing sighs, putting down his hands.

"Better go back, or I'll get scolded."

As he is about to turn back, at that moment—

"Drip, drip..."

He heard faint footsteps behind him, along with the sound of droplets falling.

Yan Jingxing turns abruptly, only to see a girl standing behind him. He hasn't noticed her approach at all.

He is a bit startled.

She looks like she has just climbed out of the sea, her slender body wrapped in a deep blue one-piece swimsuit. Wet hair, resembling seaweed, flows down to her waist, slightly curling at the ends.

The girl's bangs are quite impressive, long enough to cover her eyes. Despite that, Yan Jingxing can still feel her gaze piercing through the cover of her hair, staring at him intently.

Is this the person he saw just now?

Although there is no evidence, Yan Jingxing already believes in his judgment.

He can't help but swallow nervously.

Compared to the inexplicable excitement he feels when he hears the singing in the car, he now feels a bit scared, and even the sunlight falling on him at this moment doesn't seem so warm.

Why isn't she saying anything?

Yan Jingxing confronts her, staring at the silent girl, feeling uncomfortable all over.

Why is she staring at me like this?

Could it be... she's not a mermaid at all but a drowned ghost, climbing ashore to seek revenge?

No, there are also those monsters in myths that lure sailors with their songs, causing shipwrecks. They look like mermaids. What are they called again...

Yan Jingxing's mind is filled with chaotic thoughts as he can't help but take a step back.

"Um... excuse me, are you...?"

He gathers his courage and stutters out a question.

The girl in the swimsuit doesn't answer.

Cold water droplets keep sliding down from her hair and body, spreading wet marks on the ground.

At this moment, she seems to realize that it's inconvenient to be observed like this, so she uses her fingers to flip her hair, allowing Yan Jingxing to see her face clearly.

Perhaps due to being in the water for a long time, the girl's skin appears pale. However...

She's really pretty, he thinks.

Like the actresses on TV whose skin glows with radiance, now appearing in front of him in real life.

Compared to the people on the screen, her face clearly retains a bit of youthful innocence, making her look around his age.

The girl's eyes like black crystal balls reflect his image, and her thin lips lack a bit of color, trembling slightly.

Yan Jingxing can't help but swallow again.

For some reason, seeing her face, his emotions seem to... become even more nervous.

At this moment, the corner of the girl's lips suddenly lifts into a brilliant smile.

Then, she takes steps toward him.

"W-wait, wait..."

He doesn't react in time, and she is already in front of him, grabbing his hand and forcefully stuffing something into his palm.

"What is this..."

Yan Jingxing is surprised and quickly opens his hand.

In the palm of his hand lies several seashells and pebbles, each displaying beautiful colors or patterns.

"Gifts."

The girl speaks. Her voice is like clear springwater, with a tone identical to the clear and beautiful song he hears in the car earlier. This confirms to Yan Jingxing that she is indeed the "mermaid" he saw on the reef.

"Gifts?"

He realizes that, besides dumbly repeating her words, he can't do anything.

"Yeah. I brought them from the sea."

"Are you... a mermaid?"

"No, um..."

The long-haired girl seems to remember something and answers him with a smile.

"I'm a green-haired water monster."

"Huh?"

"Someday, a water monster will crawl out of the deep sea onto the shore."

"..."

Uh, what does that mean? Yan Jingxing is completely puzzled.

"By the way, are you a tourist? Where are you going? To Baiyue Town? Just passing through? Planning to stay there?."

She has no intention of explaining, firing off a series of questions like a machine gun.

"Y-yes, I'm going to Baiyue Town..."

"That's great. Baiyue Town is a beautiful place, although there's nothing special... Well, that's it. Consider these shells as a souvenir for your trip and take them away."

Yan Jingxing completely doesn't understand what she is saying, but by now, she is ready to leave.

The girl turns around, her wet hair flicking water droplets that sparkle in the sunlight. She takes big strides toward the sea.

"W-wait, wait..."

He doesn't have time to stop her, only to see her effortlessly leap over the reef and then—

"..."

She jumps off the edge of the cliff.

Yan Jingxing quickly runs over, grabbing a nearby stone for support. Carefully leaning over, he looks down.

A figure emerges from the water, swimming forward. The slender silhouette moves like a real fish, disappearing into the splashing waves like scattered pearls.

Standing at the edge of the cliff, Yan Jingxing stands still for a while, his mind filled with various thoughts. After a long time, he remembers that his uncle still waits at the rest stop. He secretly exclaims that it is bad, hurriedly retracing his steps along the same path.

However, the image of the mermaid singing on the cliff leaves an indelible impression in his heart. Her figure is like a storm, sweeping through the fourteen-year-old boy's heart.

This marks his first encounter with the girl named Ji Chunzao.

At that time, he has no idea that their second meeting will come so quickly and unexpectedly.
