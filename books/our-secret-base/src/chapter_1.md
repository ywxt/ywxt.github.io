# Chapter 1: Mermaid on the Highway

The Summer of 2005, Yan Jingxing returned to his hometown with his uncle.

The place was called Baiyue Town, nestled against the green mountains and facing the sea. With a harbor and fishing village along the shore, it was a typical seaside town.

Baiyue Town was not far from Jinjiang City. The drive from the city center took about three and a half hours, with buses and coaches traveling back and forth.

If it were just a visit to family or a summer retreat, he might have felt quite happy. Occasionally getting away from the city, enjoying the leisurely rural life, and having some stories to share with classmates upon return.

Unfortunately, Yan Jingxing was actually settling there. His uncle had already found a new school for him to transfer to, and he left in a hurry, not even having time to bid farewell to his high school friends, leaving a hint of resentment in his heart.

Yan Jingxing's parents lived abroad throughout the year, and he hadn't seen them for an average of one or two years since the fourth grade. Since then, his uncle Yan Yongzhi had been taking care of him.

This time, due to a job transfer, Yan Yongzhi moved from a city school to a town, and Yan Jingxing had to go with him.

...

The car smoothly traveled on the highway, and the cabin had a rhythmic, slight vibration.

The man sitting in the driver's seat held the steering wheel, looking relaxed. Old songs from Hong Kong and Taiwan played on the radio, and he hummed along off-key. The warm breeze of the summer, slightly intoxicated, rushed in through the open windows.

The teenager sitting in the passenger seat, supporting his chin with one hand, lazily gazed at the monotonous highway scenery speeding by.

The silence, without anyone speaking, lasted for a while. Yan Jingxing couldn't help but bring up the topic he had mentioned several times before.

"Uncle, I've said before, I could have stayed in the city. I can take care of myself. When you used to work overtime, I was always..."

"That was temporary, and it's different. You're still a minor. How can you not be with your guardian?"

Yan Yongzhi tapped the steering wheel with his fingers, observing the rearview mirror while comforting him.

"Don't be too upset. There are fun things in the city, and there are also beautiful sceneries in the countryside. Baiyue Town is where your dad and I grew up. There are quite a few interesting things in the town."

"Really? Like what?"

"Well, let me think. I remember when we were there, during festivals, there were markets and temple fairs. I don't know if they still have them. Because it's close to the seaside, you can go to the shore anytime to fish or swim."

"What else?"

"There are a few islands near the town. Some are tourist attractions, and some are places for burning incense and praying. Someone can take a ferry on weekends. When I have time, I'll take you there. Your dad and I used to sneak on the ferry without telling the adults. While went to the island, we could play for a whole day, and there was a time when we almost couldn't make it back...."

At this point, Yan Yongzhi suddenly realized that such stories shouldn't be told to a child, a bad example, and stopped talking.

"Sounds pretty good. Will you go with me?"

"Of course. I said, when I have time."

"When will you have time?"

"Well..."

Yan Yongzhi hesitated for a moment and decided to tell the truth.

"I just started my new job, and I'll be busy for a while. I haven't even prepared my teaching materials."

"Isn't that the same as saying nothing?"

Yan Jingxing pouted, pulled down the seat armrest, and leaned back lazily.

"You just transferred schools. Go get to know your new classmates, build good relationships with them. Also, I haven't seen you study during this time. Don't let your grades drop. We can discuss playing later...."

Yan Yongzhi's nagging made him stop listening. The teenager sighed, reclined in his seat, and continued to stare at the scenery outside the window.

However, as he gradually emptied his mind, drowsiness naturally surged into his mind. His upper and lower eyelids began to fight.

At the same time, a faint, ethereal singing voice came from a distance. Beautiful and clear, like the clear lake in the mountains, the voice belonged to a maiden.

In a daze, he thought it was the sound from the radio. Yan Jingxing quickly realized that the voice was sometimes near and sometimes far, and it obviously did not come from beside him.

But... singing?

This was in a car on a highway. Where did the singing come from?

Suddenly, his entire consciousness woke up, and he subconsciously widened his eyes, looking into the distance.

What was that?

It seemed like a person...

He thought he might have seen it wrong.

The scenery around the highway flashed at the edge of his vision. Beside the guardrail was a cliff, and below the cliff was the blue sea, with waves constantly rolling and splashing countless foam on the dark rocks.

He grabbed the seatbelt on him, turned his head back to look.

—There was a slender figure, as if from the depths of the sea, sitting quietly on a giant reef.

With her back against the sky, she had long, seaweed-like hair that shimmered with golden brilliance in the dazzling sunlight.

She was singing an unknown ancient ballad, her clear and melodious voice lingering in the airspace above the highway.

In a blink of an eye, the car had quickly left the original place, and the figure on the reef disappeared from view.

However, he couldn't help but stare with wide eyes, feeling that this scene was unforgettable.

Truly a wonderful sight.

That person, simply... like a mermaid from a fairy tale...

"Uncle, did you hear that just now?"

He turned around, unable to resist asking.

"Huh? What sound?"

Yan Yongzhi, who was humming along with the music on the radio, seemed completely unaware of what had just happened.

"Singing, someone was singing."

"Singing?"

Yan Yongzhi turned off the radio, listened carefully for a while, and said casually, "I didn't hear anything. What's wrong?"

"...Forget it, it's nothing."

Although he said "forget it," his heart couldn't help but beat uncontrollably.

The scene just now was deeply imprinted in his mind, making Yan Jingxing inexplicably impulsive.

At this moment, he saw some buildings not far from the front of the highway.

"Uncle, I see a rest area ahead?"

"Ah... there is. What's wrong?"

"I want to pee."

"Is it urgent?"

"Yeah, can't hold it."

"Alright, I'll stop here for a while."

The car slowly entered the lane leading to the rest area.

"I'll go smoke a cigarette, you can go if you want."

Yan Yongzhi turned off the engine, propped open the car door, and was about to say a few words when he saw Yan Jingxing had already jumped out of the car and ran towards the sea.

"We're almost in the town, don't go too far!"

"Okay!"

Without looking back, the teenager shouted in response.

"This kid..."

Yan Yongzhi lit a cigarette, looking puzzled as he watched his nephew's figure.

"He was just sulking earlier, and now he's excited."

...

"Hoo... hoo..."

Like driven by a strong premonition, he couldn't cool down his fervent thoughts.

Amidst the chaotic thoughts, Yan Jingxing had already left the rest stop, stretching his legs and running on the overgrown slope by the shore.

He couldn't discern a specific direction, just exerting all his strength to move forward.

The fresh scent emanating from the vegetation mixed with the salty sea breeze brushing against his cheeks. Soft soil underfoot resembled a vast, thick carpet extending endlessly.

The sun hung high, generously casting intense radiance on his hair and shoulders. As Yan Jingxing ran, he felt the heat throughout his body, accompanied by a dizzying sensation.

Before long, he began to feel strained, and sweat streamed down his forehead.

After exerting himself in this mad dash, minutes passed, and the young man's steps gradually slowed. Finally, he was exhausted, leaning on his knees and panting heavily.

While taking deep breaths, Yan Jingxing turned his head, realizing that the rest stop was nowhere in sight.

Beside him was a winding road built along the mountainside, and vehicles sped by occasionally.

"What am I even doing..."

In fact, the brief glimpse earlier was not enough for him to determine the exact location of the "mermaid" and the reef she was on. Considering the speed of the car, perhaps the distance between her and himself was even greater than he imagined.

Straightening his posture, he placed his hands over his forehead like a visor and walked to the edge of the cliff to gaze into the distance:

The winding road like a serpent, towering and rugged mountains, and the boundless sea in the distance.

At the horizon was the sight of the "meeting of sea and sky" where everything seemed to blend into a vast expanse of white.

Apart from that, there was nothing else.

The incessant sound of the sea tide echoed in his ears, with white waves constantly rolling onto the shore, leaving moist traces on the muddy ground.

Yan Jingxing sighed, putting down his hands.

"Better go back, or I'll get scolded."

As he was about to turn back, at that moment—

"Drip, drip..."

He heard faint footsteps behind him, along with the sound of droplets falling.

Yan Jingxing turned abruptly, only to see a girl standing behind him. He hadn't noticed her approach at all.

He was a bit startled.

She looked like she had just climbed out of the sea, her slender body wrapped in a deep blue one-piece swimsuit. Wet hair, resembling seaweed, flowed down to her waist, slightly curling at the ends.

The girl's bangs were quite impressive, long enough to cover her eyes. Despite that, Yan Jingxing could still feel her gaze piercing through the cover of her hair, staring at him intently.

Is this the person I saw just now?

Although there was no evidence, Yan Jingxing already believed in his judgment.

He couldn't help but swallow nervously.

Compared to the inexplicable excitement he felt when he heard the singing in the car earlier, he now felt a bit scared, and even the sunlight falling on him at this moment didn't seem so warm.

Why isn't she saying anything?

Yan Jingxing confronted her, staring at the silent girl, feeling uncomfortable all over.

Why is she staring at me like this?

Could it be... she's not a mermaid at all but a drowned ghost, climbing ashore to seek revenge?

No, there are also those monsters in myths that lure sailors with their songs, causing shipwrecks. They look like mermaids. What were they called again...

Yan Jingxing's mind was filled with chaotic thoughts as he couldn't help but take a step back.

"Um... excuse me, are you...?"

He gathered his courage and stuttered out a question.

The girl in the swimsuit didn't answer.

Cold water droplets kept sliding down from her hair and body, spreading wet marks on the ground.

At this moment, she seemed to realize that it was inconvenient to be observed like this, so she used her fingers to flip her hair, allowing Yan Jingxing to see her face clearly.

Perhaps due to being in the water for a long time, the girl's skin appeared pale. However...

She's really pretty, he thought.

Like the actresses on TV whose skin glowing with radiance, now appearing in front of him in real life.

Compared to the people on the screen, her face clearly retained a bit of youthful innocence, making her look around his age.

The girl's eyes like black crystal balls reflected his image, and her thin lips lacked a bit of color, trembling slightly.

Yan Jingxing couldn't help but swallow again.

For some reason, seeing her face, his emotions seemed to... become even more nervous.

At this moment, the corner of the girl's lips suddenly lifted into a brilliant smile.

Then, she took steps toward him.

"W-wait, wait..."

He didn't react in time, and she was already in front of him, grabbing his hand and forcefully stuffing something into his palm.

"What is this..."

Yan Jingxing was surprised and quickly opened his hand.

In the palm of his hand lay several seashells and pebbles, each displaying beautiful colors or patterns.

"Gifts."

The girl spoke. Her voice was like clear springwater, with a tone identical to the clear and beautiful song he heard in the car earlier. This confirmed to Yan Jingxing that she was indeed the "mermaid" he saw on the reef.

"Gifts?"

He realized that, besides dumbly repeating her words, he couldn't do anything.

"Yeah. I brought them from the sea."

"Are you... a mermaid?"

"No, um..."

The long-haired girl seemed to remember something and answered him with a smile.

"I'm a green-haired water monster."

"Huh?"

"Someday, a water monster will crawl out of the deep sea onto the shore."

"..."

Uh, what does that mean? Yan Jingxing was completely puzzled.

"By the way, are you a tourist? Where are you going? To Baiyue Town? Just passing through? Planning to stay there?."

She had no intention of explaining, firing off a series of questions like a machine gun.

"Y-yes, I'm going to Baiyue Town..."

"That's great. Baiyue Town is a beautiful place, although there's nothing special... Well, that's it. Consider these shells as a souvenir for your trip and take them away."

Yan Jingxing completely didn't understand what she was saying, but by now, she was ready to leave.

The girl turned around, her wet hair flicking water droplets that sparkled in the sunlight. She took big strides toward the sea.

"W-wait, wait..."

He didn't have time to stop her, only to see her effortlessly leap over the reef and then—

"..."

She jumped off the edge of the cliff.

Yan Jingxing quickly ran over, grabbing a nearby stone for support. Carefully leaning over, he looked down.

A figure emerged from the water, swimming forward. The slender silhouette moved like a real fish, disappearing into the splashing waves like scattered pearls.

Standing at the edge of the cliff, Yan Jingxing stood still for a while, his mind filled with various thoughts. After a long time, he remembered that his uncle was still waiting at the rest stop. He secretly exclaimed that it was bad, hurriedly retracing his steps along the same path.

However, the image of the mermaid singing on the cliff had already left an indelible impression in his heart. Her figure was like a storm, sweeping through the fourteen-year-old boy's heart.

This marked his first encounter with the girl named Ji Chunzao.

At that time, he had no idea that their second meeting would come so quickly and unexpectedly.
